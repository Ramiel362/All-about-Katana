                <!-- Uchigatana Card -->
                <div class="card" id="Uchi">
                    <h3 class="card-title">Uchigatana</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The Uchigatana features a curved blade that typically ranges from 60 to 80 centimeters in length, designed for quick slashing motions. It has a single-edged blade with a flat back and a sharp cutting edge, optimizing its effectiveness in combat. The tang is often longer than that of other katanas, providing a secure grip. Additionally, the handle, or tsuka, is wrapped in silk or leather for comfort and traction, while the tsuba (guard) is typically simple to allow for smooth movements during fights. For this reason, it was used by the Samurai for battles</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Tachi Card -->
                <div class="card" id="Tach">
                    <h3 class="card-title">Tachi</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The Tachi features a longer, more pronounced curve, with blade lengths typically ranging from 70 to 90 centimeters, making it suitable for mounted combat. It has a single-edged blade with a sharp cutting edge and a thicker spine, adding strength and durability. The tang is shorter compared to the Uchigatana, and the handle is often longer to accommodate two-handed use, enhancing control during slashing motions. The Tachi is characterized by its ornate tsuba (guard) and decorative elements, reflecting its status as a symbol of prestige among samurai.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Wakizashi Card -->
                <div class="card" id="Waki">
                    <h3 class="card-title">Wakizashi</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The Wakizashi is a shorter blade, typically ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters in length, designed for use in close quarters. It has a single-edged blade with a slight curve, making it effective for quick, precise strikes. The handle is proportionately smaller than that of the Uchigatana, allowing for a comfortable grip with one hand, while the tang is shorter to match the overall size of the sword. Often paired with the Uchigatana as part of the daisho (the paired set of swords), the Wakizashi serves both as a backup weapon and a tool for everyday tasks, embodying the practicality and versatility of samurai weaponry.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Nodachi Card -->
                <div class="card" id="Noda">
                    <h3 class="card-title">Nodachi</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The Nodachi is characterized by its long blade, typically measuring between 90 and 120 centimeters, designed for powerful, sweeping strikes on the battlefield. It features a single-edged blade with a gentle curve, providing both reach and cutting ability. The handle is longer than that of the Uchigatana, allowing for two-handed use, which enhances control and leverage during combat. Although less commonly used in close quarters, the Nodachi is valued for its ability to deliver devastating blows, making it a formidable weapon in the hands of skilled warriors.

           <h1>History of Katanas</h1>
           <p class="start">Yo, let me break down the history of katanas for you, my dude. These bad boys have been around since ancient Japan, like way back in the 8th century. At first, they were these straight, double-edged blades, but as the samurai started flexing their skills, the katana evolved into the sleek, curved sword we know and love today.

            Fast forward to the late Heian period (794–1185), and you’ve got the katana making its debut, perfect for those quick draws and slicing moves. As samurai culture blew up during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), swordsmiths stepped up their game, crafting blades that were tough yet flexible by folding and tempering steel—talk about craftsmanship!
            
            Then, in the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the tachi came on the scene, a longer version of the katana made for mounted warriors. But when the battlefield shifted to foot soldiers, the katana reclaimed its throne.
            
            By the Edo period (1603–1868), the katana was not just a weapon; it was a cultural icon for samurai, showcasing some serious artistry in the craftsmanship. Fast forward to the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, and the samurai went out of style, but the katana? It still rules. Today, it’s all about the respect for the art and the history behind these legendary swords, making them a must-have for collectors and martial artists everywhere. So yeah, that’s the lowdown on the katana—legendary, lit, and forever cool!
            </p> <br>
            <p class="mid">Is that all?</p> <br>
            <p class="end">Nah, there's more to the katana story! Here’s a bit more depth on its cultural significance and modern relevance:

                So, after the Meiji Restoration, while the samurai were phased out, the katana didn’t just fade away; it became a symbol of Japanese culture and identity. It’s like the ultimate representation of bushido—the samurai code of honor, courage, and loyalty. People started seeing the katana not just as a weapon but as a piece of art, with intricate designs and unique characteristics that tell a story about the swordsmith's skill.
                
                In modern times, the katana has made its way into popular culture—think movies, anime, and video games. It’s often depicted as this super cool, mystical weapon that can slice through anything, further boosting its legendary status. Plus, there are still traditional sword-making practices alive today, with master craftsmen who carry on the art form, producing blades that are both functional and breathtakingly beautiful.
                
                Martial arts schools around the world teach the way of the katana, emphasizing not just the physical skills but also the philosophy behind it. So, it’s not just about swinging a sword; it’s about embodying the spirit and discipline of the samurai. The katana is more than just a blade; it’s a timeless symbol that continues to inspire and resonate with people all over the globe. So yeah, there’s a lot of layers to the katana story, making it even cooler!
